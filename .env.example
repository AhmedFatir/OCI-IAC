These are the environment variables you need to set in order to run the terraform scripts.
You can copy this file to .env and set the values accordingly
In order to get the values for the variables, you need a OCI account and a github account

OCI variables:
You can get the values for the OCI variables from the OCI console: 
Go to "Identity -> My profile -> API keys -> Add API key" then download the private key 
And press on the three dots of the generated key to get the config file values.
create a new config file and copy the values then use the same values in the .env file.
for the private key path, it should be "/root/.oci/oci_api_key.pem" for terraform compatibility
and then mount the private key and the config file to the container in the docker-compose file

Github token:
You can get the values for the github token from your github account:
Go to "Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Generate new token(classic)" then copy the generated token and use it in the .env file
